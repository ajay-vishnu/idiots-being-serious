            So many annocements, superb day for a tech enthusiast.<br>

            It had been crazy couple of weeks with the whole internet split up if new iPhone was going to be launched or
            not.<br>

            That was cleared straight away with Tim Cook telling that they were focusing only on 2 products, the Apple
            Watch and the iPad.

            Smartwatch and tablet, two industries that Apple has dominated since the moment the entered them and fair
            enough their products are
            amazing with bleeding edge hardware, strong software support which is very important because people hardly
            upgrade tablets like the
            was they do with smartphones. I own a galaxy note 800 bought in 2012, which hardware wise is super solid,
            still works, but the problem
            is the software, it never got an update after 2014 and as expected soon after that it started lagging a lot.
            Its such a shame thinking
            how amazing it would have been if it had software support like Apple provides.<br>

            Apple devices hold pretty well even years after software support is stopped, we also own the 4th generation
            iPod, which received last
            update in 2014, but I can still boot it up, do whatever I want, yes once in a while it lags but it is way
            smoother than the note.<br>

            If someone asked me to explain the difference between software support of android and Apple devices, I would
            show them this picture:<br>

            Apple has had over 50% market share in wearable industry and close to 40% share in the tablet Industry,
            which is just a testament of how
            great those products are.<br>

            People always complain how costly Apple products are, but I will come out and say even though they cost a
            lot, more often than not they
            turn out to be worth it, with exception of the accessories, they are just outrageously expensive.<br>

            <div id="heading">Apple Watch series 6:</div>
            <p>
                Coming back to evet, they announced the 6th iteration of the Apple Watch and I just say, the colour
                palate they have gone with this year is just
                amazing, with inclusion of Product RED too, which is always nice.<br>
                Main colour I want to talk about is the navy blue, never have I ever been more mesmerised by a colour,
                it looks stunning!!

            <p>
                The main difference between the series 5 and 6 is this year they have included sensors to measure your
                blood oxygen level which is an amazing feature
                to have especially in these times. It also comes with display that can get 2.5 times brighter outdoors
                with always on display. It is swim proof, with
                S6 chip it is 20% faster than the previous generation which is always welcome.<br>

                One more feature added is the always on altimeter so if you are going on a hike you can check how high
                you are from the always on display.

                One of the most influential announcements was that Apple is not going to provide adapter with the
                devices, so we have to use our old adopters or buy new
                ones which means that most probably we won't get them with iPhones too!<br>

                A lot of people are angry about it saying Apple is just trying to soak in every dollar possible from us.
                Apple said the move is to reduce the carbon footprint
                generated every year and has said they are going carbon neutral by 2023. I kind of support this decision
                because I have like 10-15 micro usb cabels lying around
                my house and I don't even have a working condition device that uses it, I don't want to be in the same
                situation with lightning chargers too, as Apple is moving
                towards wireless future.
            </p>
            <p>
                Series 6 GPS costs $399, so Apple hasn't changed the price even after adding new hardware which is nice.
                In India it costs 40,990 INR which is a lot and is probably
                because they don't want to vary the profits gained by them in different regions and they have to pay a
                lot of taxes over here as it is not manufactured here. But they
                haven't increased it from last year so I wouldn't complain much about that.

            <div id="heading">Family Setup</div>
            <p>
                When MKBHD had Craig on the <a
                    href="https://podcasts.apple.com/in/podcast/waveform-the-mkbhd-podcast/id1474429475?i=1000479715266">Waveform
                    podcast</a> after the WWDC,
                he asked him about the section of people who don't have an iPhone but use iPad and want to use Apple
                Watch Craig
                said "it is a sensible point, we haven't pursued there yet, I wouldn't rule it out, I love my iPad and I
                love using my apple watch". Apple kind of gave a solution for those
                people, now if you don't have an iPhone but your family member does, you can connect to their iPhone and
                use it as you normally would.<br>

            <div id="heading">Apple Watch SE</div>
            <p>
                Now to the device which I was most excited about, Apple Watch SE released at $279, which is Apple's very
                own mid range watch to compete with the competition around the
                $200-300 price margin.<br>

                They did have the series 3 but it is already 3 years old, so they needed to release this guy. Apple
                Watch series 3 is still supported by Apple and it now costs $199
                which is amazing!<br>

                The undercuts to SE are expected ones, it doesn't have ECG, blood oxygen sensor and also lacks always on
                display. As the SE name suggests we would expect it to be an
                amalgamation of previous and latest apple watch, which is true as it is an amalgamation of Series 4, 5
                and 6.<br>

                It has S5 chip from series 5, features of series 4 and design and display of Series 6, which makes it
                absolutely amazing. Apple says it is 2x faster than series 3. This
                too has always on altimeter, which is great for hikers.<br>

                Bands are same as Series 6 and also having the Nike edition and difference being it doesn't have the
                stainless steel variant which was expected as you wouldn't want to
                have high end material on your mid range product, that would just bump up the price XD.

            <p>
                I think Apple has priced Apple Watch perfectly in US and they will for sure woo in a lot of customers
                who probably wouldn't have bought an Apple Watch.<br>

                It is priced at 29,900 INR in India which I think is fairly decent but Apple has maintained the pricing
                scheme and hasn't increased it at all since years, so I think that
                deserves an applause to them.

            <div id="heading">iPad 8th generation:</div>
            <p>
                This is the best Apple product, it is priced at $329 in US or 29,900 INR in India. There is also student
                discount, so if you are a student you can get it at a even lower price.

            </div>
            <p>
                It not only has A12 bionic which is a great leap in terms of performance, it is also costs 8,000 INR
                less in India which amazing!! You can buy an iPad as well as Apple pencil for
                the price of the previous generation model which is mind blowing to me in my opinion. Other than that
                there isn't much of a difference from previous generation and rightfully so,
                there isn't much that could have been changed either.<br>

                With inclusion of a more powerful chipset gaming on this would be amazing, I am not much of a gamer but
                a lot of people I know love gaming on their iPads, so they can be open to
                buying this one instead to save some money with a few compromises.
            </p>
            <div id="heading">iPad Air</div>
            <p>
                Now comes the good stuff. If 8th generation iPad killed the competition in the lower end, 4th gen iPad
                Air, just made every other Android flagship tablet obsolete. This device is
                so amazing that it makes you question your decision of buying an iPad Pro as the only difference is high
                refresh rate processor, few extra cameras and Face ID, all of which frankly
                nobody should care about. It is priced at $599 or 54,900 INR which is actually great given the awesome
                hardware it comes with.<br>

                iPad Air comes with the all new A14 bionic chipset which is made based on 5nm process, as you can guess
                makes it super powerful. It also has support for magic keyboard, so the only
                reason someone should buy an iPad Pro should be because they want the 12.9" variant, otherwise the 11"
                option is not at all worth it.<br>

                Touch ID has been placed on the lock screen and I am all for it.

            </div>
            <p>
                Until last year there was always this temptation to rather buy the cheaper iPad if you couldn't afford
                or buy the iPad Pro instead of buying the Air, but with this generation the iPad
                Air has cemented its place as a great purchase and its up to Apple make the next generation iPad Pros
                worth it, otherwise people are better off buying this guy.<br>

                With such a powerful chip I don't even need to tell you that gaming will be incredible on this device.

                conducting 11 trillion computations per second.<br>

                Samsung recently tried to resurrect android tablet market with Galaxy tab S7 series which don't get me
                wrong is an amazing device but the problem is, it is very expensive and at the same
                time Android has never been a great experience on tabelts, so it looks pretty much impossible to stop
                Apple at this point but it might happen in the future, you never know.

            <div id="heading">Apple Fitness+ and Apple One</div>
            <p>
                Other few announcements were about the Apple Fitness+ and Family One subscription, both of which in my
                opinion are absolutely amazing announcements.<br>

                Fitness+ which is not arriving to India yet, which in my opinion is an amazing service being released.
                In these times people obviously can't go to gym so announcing a service like this will please
                a lot of people. A lot of people aren't happy with the $9.99 price but in reality you would be saving a
                hefty amount more by cancelling your gym subscription, so I don't know why the outrage.<br>

                Now the announcement that I was awaiting for a long time, Apple one, a single subscription to use all
                the services.

            <p>
                These prices are way below the expected prices and also in India Apple charging very low for Apple
                services, Apple One is priced at a outrageously low price.<br>

                Individual subscription is just 195 INR($2.65) and family subscription just 365 INR($4.95).<br>

                Premiere is not coming to India yet as we don't have the Fitness+ yet, it might be announced in the
                future.

            <p>
                This in my years of watching launch events, the first multi device launch event where each and every
                product launched makes sense and has a purpose and is not something released for the sake of
                releasing.<br>

                Even though I love the Apple Watch SE, Series 6 is amazing and iPad Air got complete facelift and huge
                internal upgrades, as an Indian the stand out device was the 8th generation iPad, its amazing, released
                at a drastically lower price than last year with a great upgrade to A12 chipset. It's a complete
                package, comes with a super powerful processor, has a great display and gives total iPad experience and
                it can
                act as an ice breaker for people who are not sure about switching to Apple but don't want to get caught
                in the ecosystem very early.<br>

                Also the Family One subscription which is just amazing and is priced insanely low.<br>

                Apple has hit a masterstroke by pricing all of its devices amazingly.<br>

                At this moment any American could experience complete Apple ecosystem by buying an iPhone SE, Apple
                Watch SE and 8th gen iPad and not even have to pay a $1000 which if you had told me 2 years ago I would
                have
                called you insane, but also would've hoped you were true.
